## RPSLS | Rock🪨Paper📜Scissors✂️Lizard🦎Spock🖖
I am sure everyone is familiar with the game of Rock🪨 Paper📜 Scissors✂️. RPSLS is a game with the same concept, however, 2 new elements, lizard🦎 and spock🖖, have been added to this game. You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8) to understand the rules or you can just see read it here:
- Scissors✂️ cuts Paper📜
- Paper📜 covers Rock🪨
- Rock🪨 crushes Lizard🦎
- Lizard🦎 poisons Spock🖖
- Spock🖖 smashes Scissors✂️
- Scissors✂️ decapitates Lizard🦎
- Lizard🦎 eats Paper📜
- Paper📜 disproves Spock🖖
- Spock🦎 vaporizes Rock🪨
- (and as it always has) Rock🪨 crushes Scissors✂️

This project is a simulation of 100 of these elements bouncing into each other till one element becomes the dominant element. The program can be used to settle down argument between a maximum of 5 different opinions!
